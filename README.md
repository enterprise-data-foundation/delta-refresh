# Welcome to deltaRefresh!

**deltaRefresh** makes it easy to generate clean and consistent development environments with fresh and up-to-date testing data. It fully validates and tests your important database backups each time a lower environment gets refreshed. With all environments automatically in sync, deltaRefresh supports automated testing and deployments by bridging gaps and failures caused by "dirty" data.

**deltaRefresh** works in conjunction with deltaTest and deltaDeploy to deliver a robust, partly open-source DevOps pipeline that facilitates Test Driven Development, automated regression testing, and Continuous Delivery across your team.

With **deltaRefresh**, you can...

* Automate the environment refresh process.
* Expect developers to expedite releases with confidence.
* Prevent unnecessary breaks in productivity.

**deltaRefresh** is NOT open-source. Contact [Continuus Technologies](https://continuus-technologies.com) for more info!
